# Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Hardware Simulation

A Verilog-based digital hardware project simulating a multi-layer spiking neural network (SNN) for image input processing and neuromorphic computation.

---

## Features

- **Modular SNN Architecture:**  
  Includes programmable controller, stochastic spike generator, and parameterized neuron models.
- **Image-to-Spike Conversion:**  
  Converts RGB image data into spike trains using a 16-bit LFSR for randomness.
- **Layered Processing:**  
  Implements hidden and output neuron layers with configurable weights, bias, and thresholds.
- **Testbench Automation:**  
  Simulates video frame input, processes output, and writes results to PPM image files for easy verification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Verilog simulator (e.g., Icarus Verilog, ModelSim)
- [Optional] GTKWave for waveform viewing

### Running the Simulation

1. Place all Verilog source files in the same directory.
2. Compile and run the testbench:
   ```
   iverilog -o snn_sim sim_snn_rgb.v snn_rgb.v neuron.v gen_input.v Controller.v
   vvp snn_sim
   ```
3. View simulation output or generated `output.ppm` image.
